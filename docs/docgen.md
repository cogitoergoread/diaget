```markdown
You want a full user guide for dget.py, so I’ll review the existing project docs and CLI interface, then draft docs/usage.md with structured explanations, options, and practical examples.

Reviewed 3 files and planned usage documentation
I have enough context, and next I’ll create docs/usage.md with a complete guide covering prerequisites, install/run steps, CLI options, output behavior, and multiple command examples for real usage scenarios.

Created usage.md

Created a detailed user guide at usage.md.

Covers prerequisites, installation, CLI syntax, required/optional arguments, and exit codes.
Includes many practical examples (html, text, timeout tuning, min-text thresholds, custom user-agent, absolute output paths, logging).
Documents expected logging behavior, common workflows, troubleshooting, and known limitations.
Adds a quick help section with dget --help.
If you want, I can also add a short “Usage” section in README.md that links directly to usage.md.
